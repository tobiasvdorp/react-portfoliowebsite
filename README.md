# My Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is my portfolio website built with React. The website is bilingual, supporting both English and Dutch.

## Features

- **About Me**: This section provides an overview of my background, experience, and interests.
- **Projects**: Here, you'll find a list of projects I've completed or contributed to.
- **Skills**: An interactive folder-like interface showcasing my technical skills.
- **Contact**: A form for visitors to send me a message.
- **Secret Feature**: A "nuclear" button that "destroys" and "repairs" the website as an easter egg.
