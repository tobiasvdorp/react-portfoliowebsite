              My most recent project was building an accessible website for
              Netwerk USP Inclusief (nUSPi), an organization that champions
              inclusivity. Initially brought on board through a student
              opportunity at the HU Institute of ICT, I had the unique challenge
              of translating the organization's mission into a digital platform
              that could be easily accessed by everyone. <br></br>
              <br></br>Over a series of MS Teams meetings, I learned a lot about
              client communicationâ€”how to effectively listen, condense their
              requirements, and provide actionable feedback. One key learning
              area for me was web accessibility. Given nUSPi's focus on
              inclusivity, I learned about and implemented web standards that
              would make our digital platform accessible to as many people as
              possible.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>The project is now in its final stages, and I'm in the
              process of preparing a comprehensive handover document. This
              experience has not only been a lesson in technical development but
              also in teamwork, time management, and real-world problem-solving.
              I've come to appreciate the value of clear communication,
              especially when managing expectations and juggling various project
              elements.
