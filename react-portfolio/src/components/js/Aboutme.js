          Hey there, I'm Tobias, I'm 20 years old and I'm currently a student at
          Hogeschool Utrecht. I've always been fascinated by computers but never
          really dived deep into the world of coding, programming, or designing.
          Then I enrolled in OpenICT, and it was like finding a missing puzzle
          piece that I didn't even know was missing. I quickly realized that
          front-end development was my jam. Not only could I tinker with the
          logic and structure, but I could also unleash my creativity, making
          sure everything looked just as good as it worked. Whether it's making
          a responsive layout or adding a little animation to make the user
          interface more engaging, I relish every part of it. When I'm not busy
          coding, you'll likely find me hanging out with my friends or deep in a
          film marathonâ€”especially if it's anything by Christopher Nolan.
          'Inception,' 'Interstellar,' you name it. If it's got complex
          narratives and mind-bending twists, I'm all in. From pondering the
          mysteries of black holes to exploring the realms of psychedelics, I
          find joy in discussing the things that make you question reality and
          your place in it. So, that's a little bit about me. I'm still on a
          journey of discovery, but one thing's for sure: I've found something
          that I'm passionate about, and I can't wait to see where this road
          takes me!

                I began my educational path in the Gymnasium program, but later
                transitioned to the HAVO track. There, I not only earned my
                diploma but also received the prestigious{" "}

                for having the highest score in the entire program. After
                graduating, I took a gap year to explore my interests and
                contemplate my future goals.

Here, I'm gaining hands-on experience in Agile methodologies, customer requirement mapping, knowledge acquisition, and determining essential skills needed to deliver a product. Unique to our program is its project-based approach: we don't have traditional exams or lectures, allowing us to jump right into real-world applications. This prepares me exceptionally well for a seamless transition into the corporate world upon graduation, as we're already mastering the skills needed in the industry."
